                <h2>Origins & Early Days</h2>
                <p>With over 8,000 years of history, Aberdeen is one of Scotland's oldest cities. It started with the Pictish settlers who left behind remnants of their homes, giving rise to the region's ancient roots. By the medieval era, Aberdeen had already become a major center for trade, shipbuilding, and fishing. It developed into a royal burgh with two distinct areas—Old Aberdeen and New Aberdeen. The city still holds on to its traditions, with its historic streets and turreted buildings telling the story of Aberdeen’s enduring legacy.</p>

The city's grey granite became synonymous with its identity, earning the city the nickname "Granite City." Iconic structures like Marischal College and St. Machar’s Cathedral were built, and industrialization brought expansion. As the city grew, so did its role as a center for commerce and innovation, cementing Aberdeen’s place in Scotland’s modern era.</p>

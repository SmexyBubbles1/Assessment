                <h2>Origins & Early Days</h2>
                <p>With a history dating back over 8,000 years, Aberdeen is one of Scotland’s oldest and most significant cities. Early inhabitants, including the Picts, left behind traces of their settlements, shaping the region's ancient foundations. Over time, the city evolved into a key medieval stronghold, with its two royal burghs—Old Aberdeen and New Aberdeen—playing a crucial role in Scotland’s development. As a thriving port, it became a center of trade, connecting Scotland with Europe through fishing, commerce, and shipbuilding. The city's historic streets, fortified structures, and enduring traditions reflect its rich and dynamic past. From its deep-rooted heritage to its continuous growth, Aberdeen has always played a pivotal role in shaping the nation’s cultural and economic landscape.</p>

                    <h2>Industrial Revolution & The Granite City</h2>
                    <p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, Aberdeen underwent a dramatic transformation, earning the nickname “Granite City” due to its extensive use of locally quarried grey granite. The city's distinctive architecture, including landmarks such as Marischal College and St. Machar’s Cathedral, reflects this period of growth and development. As industrialization took hold, Aberdeen expanded rapidly, with improvements in transportation, commerce, and urban planning laying the foundation for a modern metropolis. The granite industry thrived, not only shaping the city's skyline but also contributing to major construction projects across the UK. This period saw the rise of remarkable buildings and infrastructure, shaping the city’s modern character and establishing it as a center of innovation and trade in Scotland.</p>

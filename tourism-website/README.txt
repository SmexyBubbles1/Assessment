Aberdeen Tourism Website

The website is a static web page set for the association of Aberdeen tourism. The website gives information about history, 
travels, and an interactive map of Aberdeen. It was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, namely Leaflet.js for 
the maps, in fulfilling requirements, including responsiveness, navigation, and attractive design.

The website includes 3 main pages (home, visit and history), a CSS style file and a JavaScript file for the map. For navigation,
I added links to the other pages in the header of the page for each page. Each page is layed out in the same way: header for nav, 
the banner with the title, then the main section of the page.
